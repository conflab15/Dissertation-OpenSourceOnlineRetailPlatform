# Dissertation - Developing an Open Source Single Page Application which provides low-cost sales opportunities for small businesses
My Dissertation Project is to create a Open Source Single Page Application (SPA) using Blazor, .NET 6, EntityFramework and front-end frameworks such as Bootstrap, 
and tools like SweetAlert. This solution is being developed using Feature Driven Development.
The solution provides business owners with a login to create their own business on the application, and add products to their given business. 
Business owners are able to use CRUD functionality on their products and businesses to make amendments. Business owners can view orders and change the status of items in the order!
Customers are able to register an account, browse products, and place and view their orders.

# Features of the application:
- CRUD Functionality for Businesses and Products
- Searching for Products, and filtering by Price and Title
- Searching for Businesses by town, and viewing these details, and products sold by the business
- Quickly amended stock levels of products within the business products list
- Shopping Basket and Ordering Functionality (Ability to manage the stock level within the basket)
- Order views for the Customers to see their orders
- Order Management for Businesses

- Tested using bUnit (Blazor Testing Framework) and xUnit, as well as functional testing methods
