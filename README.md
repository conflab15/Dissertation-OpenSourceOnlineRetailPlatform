# Dissertation - Developing a SaaS Retail Single Page Application which provides low-cost sales opportunities for small businesses
My Dissertation Project is to create a SaaS Retail Single Page Application (SPA) using Blazor, .NET 6, EntityFramework and front-end frameworks such as Bootstrap, 
and tools like SweetAlert. This solution is being developed using Feature Driven Development.
The solution provides business owners with a login to create their own business on the application, and add products to their given business. 
Business owners are able to use CRUD functionality on their products and businesses to make amendments.
Customers are able to register an account, and browse products on the website.

# Features to implement:
As this assignment is ongoing, I have more features to implement:
- Shopping Basket Functionality
- Checkout and Ordering - Ideally, a payment provider, such as Stripe will be implemented to take payments
- Order Management
- Role and User Management - Only business owners will be able to access functionality for business and product management
